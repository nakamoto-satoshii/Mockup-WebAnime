         On December 28, 2025; Kirigaya Suguha (Leafa) showed her cousin, Kirigaya Kazuto (Kirito), 
         a news article that the Holy Sword Excalibur in ALfheim Online (ALO) had been found. Excalibur
         was the rarest and most powerful sword in ALO, but, although Kazuto had Suguha had found the
         sword nearly a year ago, they were not able to break through the guardians of the dungeon that
         the sword was held in, until they ended up temporarily forgetting about the sword due to more
         important matters. However, Kazuto was then told that the weapon had only been discovered so 
         far, but not yet acquired. Thus Kazuto called Asuna, Lisbeth, Silica, Klein and Sinon to form
          a full party and attempt to clear the dungeon again.
